### Hi there I'm [Rahul](https://twitter.com/MrFullStackDev) <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I am a software engineer from India. My interests range from technology to design.

I have a solid understanding of computer science and web development concepts. I have dedicated a considerable amount of time to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios and applications. I am also into UI/UX designing. I've worked extensively on technologies like MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJs, NodeJs.

I've been fortunate enough to work with early-stage startups, which has further broadened my concepts around AWS, Google Ads, Wireframing and Prototyping, etc.
